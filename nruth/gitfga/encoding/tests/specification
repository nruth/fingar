Each note in the score has a name and octave
	
note
	belongs to an octave
	has a name from the set of named notes
		i.e. an individual frequency in the piece's range	
	* is distinct from notes in other octaves with the same name
	* validates its octave is in the range 1-6
	
	chromatic scale
		an ordered list of the named notes
			named notes: {A, Bb, B, C, Db, D, Eb, E, F, Gb, G, Ab}
		* of use as an object concept (for enumeration of note names)
		* should be able to resolve the next note
		* can compare notes for equality and relative position
	
		degree
			the number of a note in a scale (e.g. array index)

	octave
		The notes from a root note up to the pitch where its frequency has doubled, i.e. it repeats
		For the A chromatic scale, this is 12 semitones (all notes before repetition of A)		
		Discrete bands splitting the range into equal length segments (which will overlap the start, end, or both, of the range)
		* identifies where in the range of the piece a note is located
		* i.e. its frequency (Hz) relative to the lowest note's frequency


score: The input piece of music
	an ordered list of notes, indexed by time played from start
	* timing : each note has a starting time (relative to beginning of piece) and a duration
	* may be played over a set of possible ranges (on a guitar)
	
	Range
		the interval range of the score, determined from its highest and lowest used notes
	
	transitions
		data about the movement or effects between note states, e.g. string bends, slides, hammer-ons
	
	note container
		either a simple position encoding
		or a more complex encoding for acts such as vibrato, tremolo, some concept of polyphonic connection to other notes or being part of a chord
