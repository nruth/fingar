Each note in the score has a name and octave
	
note
	belongs to an octave
	has a name from the set of named notes
		i.e. an individual frequency in the piece's range
	(timing : has a starting time (relative to beginning of piece) and a duration)


	named notes: {A, Bb, B, C, Db, D, Eb, E, F, Gb, G, Ab}

octave
	The notes from a root note up to the pitch where its frequency has doubled, i.e. it repeats
	For the A chromatic scale, this is 11 semitones (all notes before repetition of A)		
	Discrete bands splitting the range into equal length segments (which will overlap the start, end, or both, of the range)
	* identifies where in the range of the piece a note is located
	* i.e. its frequency (Hz) relative to the lowest note's frequency
	
scale
	a cyclic ordered list of notes, ending as it is about to repeat
	* the chromatic scale (all notes) is of use as an object concept (for enumeration of note names)
	* should be able to resolve the next note

	degree
		the number of a note in a scale (e.g. array index)

score: The input piece of music
	an ordered list of notes, indexed by time played from start
	* may be played over a set of possible ranges (on a guitar)
	
	Range
		the interval range of the score, determined from its highest and lowest used notes
